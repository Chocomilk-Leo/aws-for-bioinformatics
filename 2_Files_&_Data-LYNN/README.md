In this section, you'll get information about using AWS storage for file and data storage for genomic workloads.  The general pattern is to use a data lake (concept shown above).  You'll use AWS S3 storage buckets.  Also you'll use Amazon Athena or Redshift to query files.  

Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Use S3 buckets to store files
- Use Public Genomic Datasets (reference Datasets
- Use AWS Glue to transform data
- Use Amazon Athena or Redshift to query files

## Genomics Example
