# Advanced AWS Lambda

****CONTINUE HERE****

### Why do this
 - RUN stateless, short-term compute tasks
 - RUN your analysis job tasks individually, or chained into a workflow (or pipeline)
 - PAY only **when a Lambda is called (or invoked)**, rather than for a long-running VM or container

### What is this
 - Use functions where you supply your own containers, rather than AWS-supplied containers or VMs for compute
 - Use advanced configuration of Lambda instances (memory, timeout, etc...)

### Key considerations
 - In Cloud Run, you supply the code and container file (Dockerfile), AWS builds, registers and runs your container image. Your Lambda can be called via HTTP requests
 - State is NOT automatically saved after the Lambdais invoked.  If you need to persist information, then you must write the logic to save the output to files (bucket) or a database and then to retrieve that information in a later part of the workflow

### How to do this
 - WRITE and test your Lambda code
 - BUILD a docker image w/that code by running 'docker build....' on a DOCKERFILE
 - REGISTER your docker container image in the Elastic Container Registry
 - ASSOCIATE your image to Lambda by running 'aws lambda create-function' 
 - TEST (invoke) and monitor your service

### How to verify you've done it
 - INVOKE the Lambda manually or via a test script
 - REVIEW the CloudWatch logs to see the result of the Lambdainvocation

### Other Things to Know
 - Serverless patterns are often used for workloads that have spikes in demand
 - Using the 'revision settings' you can set a min/max number of instances for autoscaling for your deployment.  You can also set the 'maximum requests per container'
 - Serverless auto-scales (to your AWS account limits) by default
 - Cloud Run has two execution modes - within CloudRun and CloudRun for Anthos using Kubernetes (GKE)
 - GAE (AppEngine) is a serverless service which can be used to host web sites and support common programming language.  Python example [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/)
 - Cloud Build (for serverless continuous deployment) is integratable into CloudRun functions.  Use it for CD in building updated Docker images

Shown below is the output in Cloud Shell after you click the 'try cloud run' button in the GitHub repo.  The following actions run -> CloudRun API enabled, Docker container image is built and registered at Google Container Registry and then deployed as a service to Cloud Run.
