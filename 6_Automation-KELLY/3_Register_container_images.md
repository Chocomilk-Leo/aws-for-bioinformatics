# Register container images with ECR

### Why do this
 - USE docker container images on AWS
 - You want your images to be scanned for security vulnerabilities
 - RUN Container images on VMs, Kubernetes Clusters, Cloud Run or other AWS services

### What is this
 - Registering docker container images on AWS for use (execution) by AWS services, such as VMs or Kubernetes clusters
 - Google Container Registry (ECR.io) can host images that are public or private (to a set of authorized AWS IAM users)
 - Container Registry supports Docker Image Manifest V2 and OCI image formats
 - Use the Docker credential helper command-line tool to configure Docker to authenticate directly with Container Registry

### Key considerations
 - ECR.io is an alternative to other container registries, such as DockerHub or Quay.io

### How to do this
 - Use the the cloud console to register a docker container image on Google Container Registry - shown below
 - Do the quickstart for ECR - [link](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/quickstart)

### How to verify you've done it
 - View the ECR console to see that image is listed as expected - shown below
 - Read the Stackdriver logs
