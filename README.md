This course covers a set of generic genomics reference architectures with explanation of key associated AWS services 
  - for detail see the `Reference` section - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics/tree/main/7_REF_Info)

AWS includes tools and services which enable genomic researchers to ingest, process and analyze their genomic datasets using the elastic scale of the AWS cloud. Image above (from AWS) shows the top-level areas in these workflows.
