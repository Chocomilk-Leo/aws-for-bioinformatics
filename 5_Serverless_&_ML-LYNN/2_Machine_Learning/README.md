# Use AWS Services for Machine Learning

Many services available:
- SageMaker & SageMaker Studio - more on this - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/Hello-AWS-Data-Services/tree/master/5_machine-learning/1_SageMaker)

****OLD CONTENT****

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS services for machine learning.  You'll use BigQuery Machine Learning.  Also you'll use Google ML APIs and services.  Additionally you'll use Google Colabs to run BigQuery ML jobs in a Jupyter notebook.  Useful presentation on notebook options for AWS - https://mco.dev/so-many-notebooks-so-little-time.../

Here are the topic pages in this section:

- USE AutoML for Vision to analyze photos and videos
Use AutoML for Text to analyze text and natural language
- USE AutoML Tables to analyze tabular data
- USE DeepVariant to perform variant analysis
- USE Deep Learning VM image to create your own ML model 
- USE Deep Learning container image to create your own ML model/container
- USE TensorQTL for very fast GPU-based QTL mapping
- USE Jupyter notebook with BigQuery API
- USE Jupyter notebook with BigQuery and BQ ML APIs


NOTE: Right click on the 'Open in Colab' button at the top of the *.ipynb (IPython notebook file) and 'open link in a new tab' as directly opening this link is blocked in GitHub.

### For More Information

I created an entire course on LinkedIn Learning on AWS Machine Learning.  Also I published a GitHub Repo with code samples for AWS Machine Learning services - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/AWS-ml) for more advanced machine learning scenarios.
