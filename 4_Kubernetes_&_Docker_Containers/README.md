# Use AWS for Kubernetes & Docker Containers

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS services to run Kubernetes and docker container images on AWS.  You'll use AWS EC2 VMs, which are called EC2 instances.  Additionally you'll use services to orchestrate clusters of VMs or docker containers such as Elastic Kubernetes Engine (or K8).  

Alternatively you can use bioinformatics pipeline & workflow languages and services to coordinate groups of VMs or containers.  These APIs include Nextflow, cromwell/WDL and others.

Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Test Docker Container Image for Pipeline
- Orchestrate Containers with GKE (Kubernetes)
- Use AWS Batch with Kubernetes
- Use Nextflow for Pipelines API

There are a number of possible ways to construct high volume data analysis workflows or pipelines on AWS with these purpose-built APIs.  In addition there is a specialized AWS API for scaling Genomics workloads on the AWS. This API is named AWS Batch.
